## Summary of works
Kun has made a first version of an enemy class and fixed some issues with the game and level classes. Olavi has made two more tower classes (bomb tower and slow tower) and a projectile class that includes bullets and bombs.

## Actions
1. Kun will look into how to get the enemies moving along the path.
2. Olavi will look into placing towers with the mouse.

# Meeting 02.12.2022 14::00

**Participants**: 
1. Kun Ren
2. Olavi Kiuru
(Veeti away at military service.)

## Summary of works
Kun has gotten the enemies to follow the path. Olavi has made it possible to place towers by clicking. We also moved most of the game logic to the level class.

## Actions
1. Kun will look into deleting enemies after they hit 0 HP. The player should also receive money when an enemy dies.
2. Olavi will look into making the bomb projectile hit many enemies.

## Project status 
The enemies now move correctly and the towers can shoot them. The UI still needs to be updated to include money, lives and instructions on how to place towers. We are close to a fully functioning first level. Adding other levels after that should not be too difficult.

## Summary of works
Kun has made multiple different enemy types. Kun has also added waves and different maps. Olavi has added the range attribute to towers. Veeti has made some sprites for the GUI. Olavi and Veeti worked together to add a level select screen, upgradable tower and a functioning GUI.

## Actions
1. The deadline is in two days. Next everyone will work together to make sure the Git has all the necessary files in the correct format and place.

## Project status 
We have a functioning game. Only thing left is to write the documentation and any other files still missing from the Git.
